## Butt Quest - The Rite of the Moon

Me and K are learning RPGMaker (MV) because we got it for cheap and we're
dumb perverts with spare time.

Javascript is bad news bears but at least it ain't ruby anymore.  Ruby gives
me hives.

### Things n stuff

- Finished the whole tutorial (town, cave, battles, endboss, ending screen)
- Made a mini-quest involving the potion lady and the two NPCs next to her.  Going to add a little bit more to it.
- Made the girl who circles the statue more interactive.  It works, but not exactly how I envisioned it.  I'll need to use plugins for that and I don't want to while I'm still learning the guts.
- Added sounds for the funny
- Made an NPC in town to learn script calls and pathing
- Lots of dialogue.  Not a fan of how the default dialogue is implemented, but that can be fixed with either a plugin or some custom code
- Drew a janky cathedral map with the default assets and put a goth girl and a dollie in there that don't do anything yet.  The map editor is bad.  I'll probably do all that in Krita or something.
- A couple real dumb NPC interactions for funsies
- Popped some free assets I found into the project to see how importing and using them worked
- Learned how to not put two spaces after a period to save space in dialogue boxes even though it's wrong and stupid
